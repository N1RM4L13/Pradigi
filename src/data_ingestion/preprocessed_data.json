      "text": "Problem Statement addressed by Pratham:\n            Recent figures for rural India indicate that over 96% of children are enrolled in school. With almost all children in school, the critical question facing the country is \u2013 are children learning?\n            Since 2005, ASER - the Annual Status of Education Report - has attempted to answer this question. Facilitated by Pratham, ASER is a nation wide household survey that reaches a representative sample of children in every rural district in India. Over 600,000 children from more than 300,000 households are reached every year. A set of basic reading and arithmetic tasks are administered one on one to each sampled child. In 2018, ASER visited 596 districts across the country.\n            Sample: ASER reading and arithmetic tool\n            Over ten years of data from the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) point to three key facts:\n            First, at every grade level, basic learning levels are unacceptably low. The All India figures from ASER 2018 suggest that only about half of all children enrolled in Std V can read at least at Std II level. A similar proportion of children are able to do a two-digit subtraction problem (with borrowing) correctly. This suggests that at least half of all children in Std V in India need immediate support.\n            Second, data from recent years shows small increases especially in lower grades, but much higher improvements are needed to bring children to up to the level of grade level expectations.\n            Third, learning trajectories over time are flat. This suggests that if children do not acquire foundational skills in the primary school years, it is unlikely that they will pick them up later."

      "text": "EVERY CHILD IN SCHOOL AND LEARNING WELL\nIn the last 20 years, India has made tremendous progress in universalizing children\u2019s access to elementary school. Since 2005, more than 90% of all children in the 6 to 14 age group have been enrolled in school. By 2010 this figure had reached 96% or more and remained that way till the pandemic. While the problem of every child in school has been largely solved, the goal of every child learning well is still far from being achieved.\nASER reports from 2005 to 2018 indicate a pattern of persistently low learning levels even for basic skills like reading and arithmetic. Even as late as 2018, the ASER survey showed that half of the sampled children in Grade 5 are struggling to read text at a Grade 2 level. Pratham\u2019s efforts for the last two decades have been largely focussed on finding a solution for this learning crisis Over the years, the approach that has evolved is called Teaching at the Right Level or TaRL.\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE TaRL: IMPLEMENTING LEARNING CAMPS IN GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS\nFrom 2012 to 2017, Pratham had been working directly on helping children in Grade 3 and above, catch up on basic reading and arithmetic. This teaching-learning approach is called Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL). Targeted at children enrolled in government schools in Grades 3 to 5, these intensive bursts of activity (30-50 days or 3 to 5 camps of 10 days each) ensured that by the end of the last camp more than 70% of children were able to read simple texts fluently and confidently do basic arithmetic operations.\nOUR VILLAGE-OUR COMMUNITY\n\nJOURNEY FROM \u2018LEARNING CAMPS-TaRL\u2019 TO HAMARA GAON:\nBuilding on the successful experiences with the TaRL Learning Camps, by 2017-18, we took several more steps. These steps were based on questions like:\n\nOnce children acquire foundational skills of reading and math, how can we help them sustain these gains, grow and learn further?\nTypically, the target population for Learning Camps has been children in Grades 3, 4 and 5 but what about children in other age groups in the village who also need help in catching up?\nMost importantly, how to prevent children from falling behind?\n\nThe overarching challenge was how to durably change the learning situation in a village or urban community such that at least basic skills or foundational literacy and numeracy was taken care of. In 2018, we decided that we should work for three to five years in the communities where we worked \u201cdirectly\u201d. (Direct interventions are those in which full-time Pratham team members work directly with schools and communities, children and teachers.) We felt it was possible to work towards the goal of all children reading and doing basic arithmetic. Not only could we support children to learn and thrive but also with the help of local people, create engaging learning environments in the community.\nTo continue to innovate and evolve, we started the multi-year \u201cHamara Gaon\u201d (Our Village/Our Community) intervention.\nThe three-year goals included ensuring that:\n\nYoung children develop strong foundational skills, become \u201cready for school\u201d and progress in a way that will not need catch up efforts in future. (Wherever possible, Hamara Gaon programs bring in a layer of Early Childhood Education working in partnership with the local Anganwadi (Early Childhood Care and Development Centres run by the government).\nChildren in Grade 3 and above learn to read fluently and with understanding, gain knowledge of numbers and become confident with basic arithmetic operations and calculations.\nChildren learn how to work in groups with other children to do projects and other activities together.\nLocal people (families, mothers, youth) engage with children to support their learning.\n\nThe overall objective of Hamara Gaon was to understand how in a period of three to five years a village could be enabled in terms of ensuring basic foundations of learning for every child at least for the elementary school age group. We also envisaged Hamara Gaon to be the active laboratory where methods of teaching-learning and materials could be developed, as well as become the locations where impacts on learning could be measured and effectiveness of the approach could be shared more widely with other partners and governments.\nHAMARA GAON PROGRAM IN POST-COVID WORLD\nThe disruptions and discontinuities due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to many changes in the way that we interacted and engaged with the Hamara Gaon communities. Here are some key elements of our renewed efforts:\nYouth Volunteers\nA stronger push for \u201ccatch up\u201d is needed to help children recover from the learning losses of the last two years. During the pandemic, we were able to successfully mobilize community volunteers who ran promising TaRL \u201ccatch up\u201d learning camps in communities. Thus, along with work with teachers and schools, youth volunteers will continue to play an ongoing role in supporting children\u2019s learning.\nMothers\u2019 Groups\nDuring the lockdown, we engaged directly with families of young children (pre-school age and those who were of Grade 1 and 2 age). We sent them activities to do with their children via phone messages (SMS and WhatsApp). We also connected regularly with families via phone calls for follow up and feedback. We saw mothers participating actively with their children. Young mothers were encouraged to form their own mothers' groups in the neighbourhood and get together regularly to do activities with their children. In the current version of Hamara Gaon, mothers and mother\u2019s groups have emerged as a vital part of young children\u2019s learning journeys.\nIn July 2020, the Government of India launched its New Education Policy (NEP 2020).\\xa0 The document strongly recommends that acquisition of foundational literacy and numeracy in primary grades should have the highest national priority. For us, too, in the next two-three years, it is very important to demonstrate that these national goals are achievable in our local Hamara Gaon communities.\nHamara Gaon today\\xa0\nThe Hamara Gaon program is usually implemented in a cluster of 25 communities (either villages or urban communities. A team of 5-6 Pratham team members are responsible for transforming this community. In 2022-23, the program was operational in 5192 communities and reached ~3,86,000 children."

      "text": "INTRODUCTION\nThe focus of Pratham\u2019s Early Childhood Education program is holistic development of children and their readiness for school in the age group of 3-8 years.\\xa0 This is done with the support of\\xa0 mothers, school teachers and volunteers in the community.\nHolistic development and school readiness include four large developmental domains:\nPhysical Development\nDevelop fine and gross motor skills, along with pre-writing abilities and ensure appropriate growth and health\nSocio-Emotional Development\nLearn to adapt to new settings & people, work in groups, individual, interaction & interpersonal skills\nCognitive Development\nDevelop basic problem-solving abilities, along with knowledge of colours, shape, symbols etc that are essential for pre-math\nLanguage Development\nDevelop basic vocabulary and improve the ability to express ideas confidently, both individually and in groups\n\n\nContext\nEarly Childhood is a period where brain development is at its peak. Fostering appropriate developmental abilities of children at this crucial stage has been closely associated with improved outcomes, such as better preparedness for school, enhanced retention and all round development of the child.\nThere is clearly a need to look at the 3 to 8 year old age group in India very closely.The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER 2018) on \u2018Young Children\u2019 shows that across India, 28.8% of children at age 3 do not attend any government or private preschool. This report also shows a wide variation in enrollment patterns across states. While the National Education Policy 2020 has laid out that the appropriate age for a child to enter grade 1 is 6 years of age, a significant number of children in government schools are age 5 or below. The data also indicated that children who enter school before the appropriate age of 6 do comparatively worse than their older counterparts in the same grade.\n\nKey Elements\nSome distinguishing elements of Pratham\u2019s approach towards Early Childhood Education are:\nLocal Resources\nContextual content & low-cost material\nRegular Assessment\nMother Engagement\nThis instructor or teacher is a local community member, who has a strong understanding of the local context, which helps her effectively interact with children and engage with parents.\nThe content is based on the child\u2019s immediate surroundings. Activities are conducted with children in varying setups \u2013 big groups, small groups and individually \u2013 and are supported with contextualized print and play material such as flash cards, story books, story cards, picture cards, beads, clay and locally available objects of daily use.\nChildren are regularly assessed by instructors through simple activities and observations. Indicators for assessment are such that they are easy to observe, measure and communicate. The findings of these periodic assessments help instructors track children\u2019s progress and are regularly communicated to parents as an engagement tool.\nMothers are also engaged through periodic meetings, creation of mothers\u2019 groups in the community and individual home visits. Mother engagement includes discussions, games and material creation and distribution.\n\nDelivery Models\nPratham\u2019s work in Early Childhood Education began over 25 years ago with community-based preschool centres in Mumbai, which were run by local young women. Over the years, the program has evolved to include multiple delivery models to suit the dynamic contexts and needs of different geographies across India. Today, Pratham\u2019s ECE program is implemented in the following ways:\nDIRECT APPROACH:\nAnganwadi Support: This involves mobilization of community volunteers to provide daily instructional activities to children in anganwadis, form and work with mothers\u2019 groups and conduct community events. Pratham provides training and on-site monitoring support to volunteers.\\xa0Pratham\u2019s anganwadi support model follows a \u2018teaching in, reaching out\u2019 approach where efforts are made to engage children both within the institution (i.e. anganwadis) as well as outside it \u2013 at home and in the community.\nPratham partners with ICDS and provides support to anganwadi workers across the block.\\xa0Pratham provides content, material, and demonstrates appropriate teaching practices and supports anganwadi workers in carrying out learning activities with children.\nOutside the anganwadi, Pratham engages mothers in the community and encourages them to participate in their child\u2019s learning process. This is done by forming mothers\u2019 groups in every community and facilitating regular meetings where Pratham staff and community volunteers demonstrate learning activities for them to conduct with their children at home and discuss any issues related to their children\u2019s education.\nPratham also conducts school readiness melas in every community before the start of each school year for children about to enter grade 1. This mela encourages a mother and child to come together to participate in the learning focused activities.\nSee school readiness melas in action in Rajasthan and Assam.\nGOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIP APPROACH:\nIn formal government partnerships, Pratham partners with the state/district-level government to strengthen existing government infrastructure and resources for the quality provision of Early Childhood Education, either in Anganwadi centres or in pre-primary classes and early grades within government schools. Pratham and the government jointly work towards the development of the program, including designing curriculum and material, training government personnel and supporting other key elements such as on-site monitoring and mentoring, measurement and assessment and periodic reviews. Pratham views these government partnerships as a key pathway to achieving systemic change.\n\nMeasurement\nPratham has an observation- and activity-based approach to measuring children\u2019s progress under the Early Childhood Education program. Assessment under the program is done in two ways:\nTeacher-Led Assessment\nSample Based Assessment\nPeriodic observation-based assessments by the Anganwadi worker/Pratham instructor/school teacher to help understand how each child is doing and track progress over the course of the year.\nThis information is communicated to parents via a Child Report Card with easy-to-understand grading indicators. Pratham uses this as an effective engagement tool for parents.\nBaseline and endline assessments of randomly sampled children from intervention and control units conducted by external Pratham observers. Oral, written and observed data is collected on a variety of activities conducted individually and in small and large groups.\nUsed to understand the impact of Pratham interventions on preschool children enrolled in Balwadis/Anganwadis as compared to children in the same areas who are not part of Pratham interventions.\nData is collected and can be used for analysis to understand overall status of learning gains through Pratham programs.\nThis instructor or teacher is a local community member, who has a strong understanding of the local context, which helps her effectively interact with children and engage with parents.\nThe content is based on the child\u2019s immediate surroundings. Activities are conducted with children in varying setups \u2013 big groups, small groups and individually \u2013 and are supported with contextualized print and play material such as flash cards, story books, story cards, picture cards, beads, clay and locally available objects of daily use.\nChildren are regularly assessed by instructors through simple activities and observations. Indicators for assessment are such that they are easy to observe, measure and communicate. The findings of these periodic assessments help instructors track children\u2019s progress and are regularly communicated to parents as an engagement tool.\nMothers are also engaged through periodic meetings, creation of mothers\u2019 groups in the community and individual home visits. Mother engagement includes discussions, games and material creation and distribution.\n\nReach and Scale\nPratham reaches about 492,000 children through its various ECE programs (around 92,000 through direct programs and an estimated 400,000 through government partnerships). Pratham also facilitated the creation of about 37,000 mothers\u2019 groups.\nPratham\u2019s ECE program is currently active, through either the demonstrations or anganwadi support, in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Delhi, Gujarat, Bihar and Odisha.\nPratham is in state government partnerships for Early Childhood Education in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Haryana.\n\nContact\nece@pratham.org\n\nDOCUMENTS\nChild Report Card \u2013Click here to read\nEarly Years Research and Evaluation Summary Note \u2013\\xa0Click here to read"

      "text": "More than 95% of 6-14 year-old children in India are enrolled in schools. However, ASER and other surveys show that a significant proportion of these children complete primary schooling without acquiring foundational reading and arithmetic skills, and therefore, are unable to cope with subsequent curricular expectations. One of Pratham\u2019s key goals is to enable such children acquire basic reading and arithmetic skills, quickly and sustainably, so that they can meaningfully benefit from further education opportunities.\n\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nPratham has developed the CAMaL pedagogy, which stands for Combined Activities for Maximised Learning, to help children \u201ccatch up\u201d. CAMaL is a child-centered pedagogy that builds on the Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) approach, pioneered by Pratham, that uses instructions and activities tailored and aligned to the learning level of the child.\nAt Pratham, we believe that a combination of activities helps children engage and learn. For example, reading aloud, participating in discussions on what they have read or heard, activities with phonetic charts, playing a variety of word games, expressing their own views orally and on paper \u2013 are all part of the process of learning to read. We do activities with children in large groups, small groups and individually.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION\n\nPratham\u2019s foundational learning programs for 6-14 years-olds are primarily implemented in two modes:\n\nGovernment partnership programs are implemented in partnerships with relevant state or district governments.\nDirect programs are implemented by Pratham teams, in collaboration with communities, volunteers and local schools.\n\nKey aspects similar across the two modes of implementation:\n\nAt the start of a program, clear, achievable learning goals are articulated so that teams, teachers and other stakeholders know what is to be achieved.\nSimple assessment is used to group children for instruction. Later in the program, similar assessments are used to track children\u2019s progress and for regrouping as children make progress.\nEven though children may be enrolled in Grades 3, 4, or 5, children are grouped by levels rather than by grades. As children make progress, they move into more advanced groups.\nPratham\u2019s method relies on a set of daily activities to maximise learning.\nAppropriate but low-cost teaching-learning materials are developed for the programs; each group has materials to support their activities.\n\nGovernment Partnership Programs:\nModel: In our government partnership programs, teachers trained in Pratham\u2019s CAMaL methodology conduct teaching-learning activities in schools. As mentioned above, children are grouped by their learning levels, using the TaRL approach, and targeted reading and arithmetic activities are conducted for 2-3 hours a day.\n\n \nThe teachers are trained, mentored and supported by a cadre of Key Resource Persons (KRPs), typically comprising block and cluster level officials as well as Pratham staff. The KRPs, who we consider as \u201cLeaders of Practice\u201d, are a critical pillar of Pratham\u2019s government partnership programs. Pratham staff trains the KRPs and supports them through the practice classes they are required to run before they train teachers. The practice classes, based on the learning by doing philosophy, enable the KRPs to see first-hand the efficacy and simplicity of the CAMaL pedagogy and equip them to subsequently support and guide the teachers. In addition to mentoring and support, periodic data-based reviews are conducted at different levels of the education system to help assess progress and identify improvement strategies.\n\nLearning improvement seen in 2022-23 Pratham-Government of Andhra Pradesh Partnership program for Grades 3 to 5\n\n \nPerformance in Language: Grades 3-5\n\nChildren who could read at least a simple paragraph (Grade 1 level text) increased by 26 percent points, from 38% at baseline to 64% at endline\n\n\nIn Grade 3 30-percentage, Grade 4 26-percentage, Grade 5 22-percentage point improvement in reading at least a paragraph level text\nIn each grade, there has been a high reduction in the percentage of children who could not even recognise letters (i.e. beginner level)\n\nPratham-Government partnerships across India (2022-2023)\nIn 2022-23, Pratham had elementary years (Grade 1-8) government partnerships in nine states and Union Territories and reached over 2.7 million children\n\n \n\n\nDirect Programs:\n\nIn 2022-23, for elementary years, Pratham\u2019s direct programs spanned across 23 states and Union Territories and reached more than 574,000 children.

      "text": "India has achieved almost universal enrollment at primary schooling, however, the trend does not sustain as children graduate to secondary grades and upwards. Over the last decade or so, girls have dropped out of school disproportionately due to factors like early marriage, chores at home and cost of education [National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21) data].\nPratham\u2019s experience indicates that once a learner has dropped out of school, it is near impossible for them to find their way back. While India has open schooling opportunities, there is lack of awareness, accessibility, adequate motivation and support for a student to use open schooling as a way to continue their education.\nFewer people progressing for higher studies, low quality secondary education, an ever-increasing demand of a skilled labour force reinforces the need for an effective intervention in the secondary education space. A secondary school certificate is a prerequisite for entry into higher education, skill apprenticeship and for promotion in jobs. Pratham believes that by making education accessible and closer to home, it is possible to overcome logistical and social challenges and begin to bridge the gender gap in learning and education.\nUnderstanding the importance of secondary education, especially Grade 10, Pratham has deployed a focused intervention, the Second Chance program, to enable young girls and women to complete their secondary schooling and forge strong pathways for the future.\n\nApproach\n\nPratham's Second Chance program focuses on providing school dropouts, especially young girls and women, another chance at education. Second Chance aims to support those who could not complete their secondary education. The program focuses on completion of Grade 10. The academic certificate that they receive opens the door for further opportunities for lifelong learning and growth. The Second Chance program uses innovative teaching methods, to provide accessible learning opportunities very close to where the students live.\n\nREACH & SCALE\n\nOver the years, Pratham has reached more than 40,000 learners through the Second Chance program.\n\nCurrently, the Second Chance program is operational in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.\n\n\nJilanba\n \nOnce a school dropout, this 19-year-old from Gujarat now aspires to become a police officerread more\n\n\nSummaia\n \nA school dropout and a mother of two children resumed her education after a gap of 20 yearsread more\n\n\nTameshwari\n \nSecond Chance program enables homemaker from Chhattisgarh to become financially independentread more\n\nDELIVERY MODELS\n\nThe Second Chance program prepares and supports students to take the Grade 10 \u2013 Secondary Board/Open School examinations. The program runs in two phases. The first phase is called the Foundation Course (FC) which lasts for 3-4 months and focuses on basic foundational concepts of subjects like English, Mathematics, Language (state-specific), Science and Home Science. Assessment in the form of a pre-test at the onset of FC and post-test at the end of FC are conducted to track the learning levels of students and their growth during the course. During this phase, life skills-focused activities are also conducted with the learners, concentrating on enhancement of communication, decision-making and critical thinking skills.\nAfter the Foundation Course, students move to the Main Course which focuses on helping learners prepare for the Board-mandated curriculum. The progress during the Main Course is tracked through internal assessments. Interactive methods such as activity-based learning, group work and an emphasis on self-learning are the highlights of the course. The Main Course formally ends with the students appearing for the Board Examination.\nAdditionally, the program delivers non-academic modules focused on providing learners exposure to available opportunities after Grade 10."

      "text": "INTRODUCTION\nThe Hybrid learning program involves getting children in the age group 10-14 in a village to form their own groups of 5-6 each, thus enabling them to co-create a learning space within their community. Digital devices and content placed directly in the hands of children providing them with opportunities and choices to learn on their own. Community based children\u2019s groups engage in choice-based learning and are guided by the coaches and youth members in the communities. The communities are organized to facilitate and support the learning activities and assessments.\nThe program aims to create an open learning mechanism enabling children and youth to prepare for school, work, and life. The program has been designed on the premise that children can be motivated to learn on their own. Children learn on tablets and do projects or conduct activities (e.g. role plays, playing games)\\xa0and then present what they have learned either in front of a live audience of parents or on a video.\nOur internal assessments (an RCT conducted in Dausa, Rajasthan) indicate that children in treatment groups perform about 12 percentage points better than the control groups in school curricular subjects, although they are not taught and there is no age-grade curriculum mapped to textbooks created. There are three factors that likely affect the outcome:\nGroup Learning\nSimplified and Interactive Content\nA general increase in motivation to learn which counters the negative response to the boredom of the classroom. (over the last two years the average monthly use of tablets by groups is 13 days/month for about an hour every day although there is no \u201cclass\u201d held and no one tells them to sit and study.)\n\n\nPraDigi \u2013 \u2018Pratham Digital\u2019\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BQegwLRvls&t=4s\n\n\nApproach\nPratham believes that it takes a village and technology to educate a child. Therefore, Pratham has identified three pillars for the implementation of the H Learning program \u2013 Social Structure, Digital Infrastructure and Teaching Learning Methodology.\nsocial structure\nPratham works with the village/urban community to create an environment of learning for children. This is done by interacting with different stakeholders of the community, raising awareness on the education scenario in their community and creating ownership amongst them for the learning interventions.\nDigital Infrastructure\nThe technology aspect of the project involves providing the community access to different digital devices to enhance creation of open learning spaces. This is implemented to motivate the volunteers to facilitate the children\u2019s groups while ensuring the continuation of their own education and learning.\nLearning Content\nPratham strives to make content engaging and interesting for learners. It works across three domains of learning \u2013 preparation for school, work and life. With the focus on creating contextualized content, the program curatesvideos and games into interesting packages \u2013 \u201ccourses\u201d. Making learning a choice- driven process. Task based games are being introduced to enable computational thinking among learners.\nBuilding on the know-how, success and reach of our education programs, the digital content endeavours to be an additional input in the overall development of children. Additionally, Pratham collaborates with numerous NGO Partners and platforms, to curate, develop and co-create learning resources for the non-traditional curriculum.\n\n\nContext\nPratham started its digital intervention with the Hybrid learning program in the year 2015. Today, the H-learning program is a community driven, digitally aided intervention running in approximately 1000 communities of Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh reaching out to over 60,000 students with 6,000 tablets. In 2019, the program has been initiated in urban communities of Pune, Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai.\nSubsequently, the digital resources and tablets were made available in Pratham\u2019s foundational programs, Vocational Programs and in the Early Childhood Education programs on an experimental basis. Today, digital hardware and software is available across 21 states reaching 300,000 learners through 18,000 tablets across India. These resources created for different age groups are available on the Pratham Open School YouTube Channel and as learning applications on the Google Playstore.The support of donors and partners has not only led to the expansion of Pratham\u2019s digital programs but also enabled the formation of core content groups within Pratham, producing over 2500 videos and 300 learning games across 11 regional languages.\nThe 1000 communities of the Hybrid Learning Program continue to be \u2018demonstration sites\u2019 where new ideas are implemented, and new resources are experimented with. The program has evolved to enable the learner to make choices from an array of \u2018courses\u2019 available across domains and areas of interests. It has also empowered the community by engaging stakeholders and creating a cadre of village level facilitators or \u2018coaches\u2019 to support the learning ecosystem in the community.\n\n\nMeasurement\nPratham in its digital intervention measures the involvement and motivation of students through their interaction with the device and their engagement with the content resources. This helps us understand students\u2019 choice, viewing behaviour and interests.\n\n\nContact\ndigital@pratham.org\n\n\nDOCUMENTS"

      "text": "The Pratham Council for Vulnerable Children (PCVC) is the child protection vertical of Pratham with the vision of \u2018Every Child's Rights Protected, Every Child in School and Learning Well.\u2019\nStarted in 2001, PCVC\u2019s focus has evolved from rescue and rehabilitation of child labourers and children in difficult situations to adopting a rights-based approach towards protection and safeguarding the rights\u00a0of children.\n\n\nCONTEXT\n\nPCVC started as an outreach program with extensive intervention work in the urban communities of Mumbai consisting of poor migrant families.\nWe identified thousands of working children between 6 and 18 years of age, engaged in industries like bag-making, shoe-making, cap-making, zari, gold polishing etc. Most of these children were migrants primarily belonging to Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.\nThe outreach\u2019s major intervention was to rescue children in coordination with the police and the Labour Department and persuading employers not to employ children for work.\nExtensive work was then carried out in both source states and destination states of child labourers to mitigate child labour and help repatriated children receive available compensation and rehabilitation facilities.\n\nOver the years, PCVC strengthened its interventions, reaching not only to child labourers but also children on move (unsafe migration of children, runaway children, street children), children with disability, children affected by natural or man-made calamities, children in institutions, children suffering from substance abuse, children in conflict with law, child survivors of sexual abuse and children belonging to the mostmarginalised communities.\nThrough its work, PCVC strives to reduce the vulnerabilities so as to create a safety net for children by strengthening the child protection mechanisms through partnerships with government and non-government organisations."

      "text": "What is CAMaL Ka Camp?\nA Summer Catch-Up Camp for Children\nAnnual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2022 data shows that only 42.8% of Grade V children can read text at Grade II level. This figure was 50.4% in 2018.\n\nSchool enrollment of children in the 6-14 age group has progressively increased over the years. It reached 96% in 2010 and remained that way till the pandemic. While the problem of \u201cevery child in school\u201d has been largely solved, the goal of \u201cevery child learning well\u201d is still far from being achieved.\n\nEven before the COVID-19 pandemic, ASER data showed that children's ability to read or do basic arithmetic needed substantial strengthening in India. Moreover, the pandemic exacerbated this issue, as prolonged school closures and economic disruptions in families led to major learning gaps among children (ASER 2022 data).\nThe summer of 2023 presented an invaluable opportunity to address the issue of learning gaps and help children before the next school year began. CAMaL ka Camp 2023 (CAMaL: Combined Activities for Maximized Learning) focussed on students in Grade V transitioning to Grade VI in the academic year 2023-24, as well as students in Grades IV and VI.\n\nDuring the six-week camp, children were engaged in various learning activities to enable them to participate and communicate effectively.\n\nWhat did we do?\nIn the summer of 2023 (May-June), Pratham facilitated catch-up camps for children transitioning from primary to the middle school through youth volunteers and government support. The goal was that all children who participated in the six-week camp would be able to read fluently with understanding and that they should be able to express their thoughts orally and in writing by the end of the camp.\nImplemented across the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, the summer camps witnessed overwhelming response, thanks to the concerted efforts of over 300,000 dedicated volunteers, predominantly youth aged 16 to 20, studying in Grade XI-XII.\nLearning was made engaging through various activities. A warm-up involved simple learning games. Storytelling and discussions followed, leading to writing activities. Focus later shifted to letters and words with games like Bara-khadi. Each child created a comprehensive dictionary with words, meanings, sentences, and pictures. Math word problems concluded the class.\n\nCampaign Ran For 6 Weeks\n\nWeek 1\nWarm-up activities with children and a baseline assessment to evaluate the current learning levels.\nWeek 2\nFollowed by four weeks of instructional activities to teach and track children's progress.\nWeek 3\nFinal week showcased the results of\ntheir progress\n\nReached 3.48 million children (Grades IV-V-VI)\nImplemented Across\nBihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh\n\n165\ndistricts of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh\n\n \n\n1,600\nblocks\n\n \n\n141,000\ncommunities and villages covered\n\nHighlights of 2023 Summer Camp\n\nGovernment Collaboration\nThe formal support from the Education Departments of the Governments of Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, as well as the continuous support received at the district and sub-district levels in Uttar Pradesh, played a pivotal role in ensuring the smooth execution of the summer camps.\nTraining and Technology\nEvery volunteer underwent short yet comprehensive training, equipped with a detailed manual outlining all the activities to be conducted, including resources such as para and story cards and QR codes to access short activity videos. Additionally, they were provided with Hindi language tools and data collection formats. To streamline the process, we employed a user-friendly weblink for volunteer registration, profile updates, and assessment data submission.\nMonitoring and Evaluation\nTo maintain quality and accountability, our dedicated teams from Pratham and government personnel conducted regular on-site visits and telephonic calls to assess progress and verify assessment data submitted by volunteers. This meticulous oversight ensured the credibility and reliability of our outcomes.\n\nOutcomes and Impact\n\nThe results have been nothing short of extraordinary. Each of the three states witnessed at least a 24-percentage point improvement in children's ability to read a Grade II level text after only four weeks of instructional activities. The impact has been far-reaching, sparking the need to build from here and ensure a brighter future for these young children."
