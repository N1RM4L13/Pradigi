ABOUT US

Introduction
Pratham is an innovative learning organization created to improve the quality of education in India. As one of the largest non-governmental organizations in the country, Pratham focuses on high-quality, low-cost, and replicable interventions to address gaps in the education system. Established in 1995 to provide education to children in the slums of Mumbai, Pratham has grown both in scope and geographical coverage.
Pratham means 'first' in Sanskrit. True to its name, it is the first major organization to achieve lasting, wide-scale success in India's educational landscape. This has been made possible due to various policies and strategies adopted by the organization.

Dedicated To Large-Scale Change
The mission to improve the quality of education in India and ensure that all children not only attend but also thrive in school is being accomplished by working in collaboration with the government, local communities, parents, teachers, volunteers, and civil society members. Our programs aim to supplement rather than replace governmental efforts. They are implemented on a large scale to not only reach as many children as possible, but also to create an adoptable demonstration model for state governments.

A Focus on Innovation
Pratham’s strategies reconfigure teaching methodologies, break down traditional tactics,
and challenge the current rote learning mechanisms in our schools. Our programs are innovative and outcome-driven. In its early years Pratham developed innovative teaching-learning approaches, materials, and measurement methods. In 2005, we pioneered a nationwide survey of schooling and learning that has had a major impact on national and international policy discussions.

Low-Cost, Replicable Models
Pratham has worked to develop low-cost, replicable models that can easily spread and be adopted by other organizations. Thousands of volunteers work with Pratham to implement learning interventions at the grassroots level. These volunteers are mobilized, trained, and monitored by the Pratham team. They are also provided with teaching-learning material and books developed by Pratham. Not only does this ensure more effective implementation of the programs, but it also helps to build an infrastructure focused on providing quality education to children.

Teaching at the Right Level

Understanding the PROBLEM
Recent figures for rural India indicate that over 96% of children are enrolled in school. With almost all children in school, the critical question facing the country is – are children learning?
Since 2005, ASER - the Annual Status of Education Report - has attempted to answer this question. Facilitated by Pratham, ASER is a nation wide household survey that reaches a representative sample of children in every rural district in India. Over 600,000 children from more than 300,000 households are reached every year. A set of basic reading and arithmetic tasks are administered one on one to each sampled child. In 2018, ASER visited 596 districts across the country.
Sample: ASER reading and arithmetic tool
Over ten years of data from the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) point to three key facts:
First, at every grade level, basic learning levels are unacceptably low. The All India figures from ASER 2018 suggest that only about half of all children enrolled in Std V can read at least at Std II level. A similar proportion of children are able to do a two-digit subtraction problem (with borrowing) correctly. This suggests that at least half of all children in Std V in India need immediate support.
Second, data from recent years shows small increases especially in lower grades, but much higher improvements are needed to bring children to up to the level of grade level expectations.
Third, learning trajectories over time are flat. This suggests that if children do not acquire foundational skills in the primary school years, it is unlikely that they will pick them up later.

Going behind the headlines of ASER
Here is a table from ASER 2018 that shows reading levels for Std III to V. Not only do we see a large proportion of children at low levels of reading, but the variation in each grade is wide. For example: In Std V, while 50% of all children can read Std II level text (or even higher), the rest are not yet at Std II level. Close to 18% children are only able to recognize letters or yet to acquire that skill. 13% can read simple words but not sentences and another 19% are just about reading text at Std I level. This situation presents a huge challenge to any teacher. What should a teacher teach? And to whom? In a typical Indian classroom, the Std V teacher teaches from the Std V textbook and thus only the “top of the class” benefits from her teaching.

All India all rural districts:
Representative sample of all children from household survey
% Children in govt schools in Std III who can at least do subtraction: Selected States ASER 2018
The ASER 2018 graph on the left shows the proportion of Std III children enrolled in government schools who can at least do a numerical two digit subtraction problem with borrowing. (This kind of problem is usually found in Std II math textbooks in states). The All India figure indicates that approximately 21% of children can do this task correctly. However there is wide variation across the country with stats like Kerala, Himachal Pradesh or Punjab where more than 40% children can do this correctly to states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh where this figure is lower than 15%. If we consider these levels as a proxy for the proportion of children who are at grade level in Std III, we can see that a substantial jump is required to help children get close to grade level expectations.

Guided Tour of Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL)

A possible solution for acquiring foundational  skills : Teaching at the Right Level
Over the last fifteen years, Pratham has evolved a solution called Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) which enables children to acquire foundational skills, like reading and arithmetic quickly. Regardless of age or grade, teaching starts at the level of the child. This is what is meant by “Teaching at the Right level”. The TaRL method developed by Pratham was originally designed keeping in mind children who have already reached Std. III, IV or V but still have not acquired basic skills. The focus is on helping children with basic reading, understanding, expressing themselves as well as arithmetic skills. These are foundational building blocks that help a child to move forward. Studies have shown that once acquired these capabilities endure over time. TaRL is an effective and low-cost strategy that helps children to “catch up” in a short period of time. Children, who are 7 or 8 and older and have been in school for a few years, can “pick up” quickly.
2. Children’s groups are made according to the basic assessment. Available teachers or instructors allocated to facilitate group activities and to guide children’s work.
1. Simple one-on-one assessment done to group Std. III, IV and V children by level rather than by grade.
4. Similar assessment used for tracking children’s progress, periodically and to guide onsite monitoring.
3. For each group there are a set of activities and materials appropriate for their level.
 
Children learn in groups and also individually. Teachers or instructors do activities with groups.
As children make progress they move into the next group.

To be effective, the “Teaching at the Right Level” approach needs to be embedded in a larger eco-system whose elements are aligned to support and ensure learning for all children. Here are the main features of the school system that need to be changed to ensure that learning for all is possible.
  --  Business as Usual  --    --  Teaching aT THE RIGHT LEVEL


GOAL  |  Goal is to complete the grade
level textbook.  |    |  Clearly articulated goals for basic reading and arithmetic. Goal is to ensure basic foundational skills for all.

TRAINING & MENTORING  |  Resource persons as trainers. Weak ongoing, on-site support by those who have trained teachers.  |    |  "Leaders of practice" created via "learning by doing. 
Select Government cadre "practice" the approach for 20-25 days and taste " success, then train teachers and provide ongoing on-site monitoring and mentoring.

GROUPING  |  Full class teaching at grade level.  |    |  Children grouped by level rather than by grade for instruction. Children move quickly from one group to next as they progress. “Teaching at the Right Level”.

TEACHING & ACTIVITIES  |  “Chalk and talk”.  Textbook driven. Teaching to the "top of the class"  |    |  Simple framework of daily activities that 
can be adapted as children progress. (CAMaL – 
Combined Activities for Maximized Learning).  Activities 
in big groups, small groups and individually.

ASSESSMENT MEASUREMENT DATA REVIEW  |  Pen-paper grade level test done at the beginning of a phase and at the end.  |    |  Simple quick one-on-one oral assessment used at start 
for grouping.  Similar assessment used periodically to track progress. Data discussion and review at all levels. Aggregate school or class-level data used to propel program not child-wise data.

Big change is possible
Today Pratham’s “TaRL” approach is implemented in two ways – directly by Pratham instructors through “Learning Camps” or as part of a Pratham-government partnership programs where government teachers implement TaRL as part of the school day. In the direct model, Pratham instructors run “Learning Camps”, 30-50 days of instruction (3 to 5 camps of 10 days each), for about 3 hours a day. In the partnership model, government teachers use this approach over a longer period in the school year (four to six months) with dedicated time for 1-2 hours a day.
Here is an example of learning improvement seen in the 2017-18 Pratham-Goverment of Karnataka Partnership Program for Std. IV & V:
In the 2018-19 school year, Pratham is partnering with several state governments to help children acquire foundational skills. These states include Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir and in some districts for Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand and West Bengal.

Programs

Education

Pratham addresses gaps in education systems with innovative, low-cost, replicable interventions that span the age spectrum. Working both directly and through government systems, these programs collectively reach millions of children and thousands of school dropouts each year. In “direct” work, a Pratham instructor works with children either in the school or in the community, whereas the “partnership” model involves Pratham teams working closely with government teams at the state, district or city level to design and implement programs. Pratham’s approach to improving learning outcomes continues to serve as a model, both within India and beyond.

Early Childhood Education
Pratham’s Early Childhood Education program works with children in the age group of 3-6 years on physical, language, cognitive and social-emotional development.

Elementary
Grounded in Pratham’s Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) approach, interventions with Grades 1-5 are proven effective at improving children’s reading and math learning outcomes.

Beyond Elementary
The Second Chance program provides school dropouts—especially women—with another chance at education, focusing on Grade 10 completion.

Digital Initiatives
Across age groups, Pratham leverages innovative technology so children and youth can take education into their own hands.

International Collaborations
Adaptations of the Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) approach address children’s low learning levels in countries around the world.

Hamara Gaon

EVERY CHILD IN SCHOOL AND LEARNING WELL
In the last 20 years, India has made tremendous progress in universalizing children’s access to elementary school. Since 2005, more than 90% of all children in the 6 to 14 age group have been enrolled in school. By 2010 this figure had reached 96% or more and remained that way till the pandemic. While the problem of every child in school has been largely solved, the goal of every child learning well is still far from being achieved.
ASER reports from 2005 to 2018 indicate a pattern of persistently low learning levels even for basic skills like reading and arithmetic. Even as late as 2018, the ASER survey showed that half of the sampled children in Grade 5 are struggling to read text at a Grade 2 level. Pratham’s efforts for the last two decades have been largely focussed on finding a solution for this learning crisis Over the years, the approach that has evolved is called Teaching at the Right Level or TaRL.
DEVELOPMENT OF THE TaRL: IMPLEMENTING LEARNING CAMPS IN GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS
From 2012 to 2017, Pratham had been working directly on helping children in Grade 3 and above, catch up on basic reading and arithmetic. This teaching-learning approach is called Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL). Targeted at children enrolled in government schools in Grades 3 to 5, these intensive bursts of activity (30-50 days or 3 to 5 camps of 10 days each) ensured that by the end of the last camp more than 70% of children were able to read simple texts fluently and confidently do basic arithmetic operations.
OUR VILLAGE-OUR COMMUNITY

JOURNEY FROM ‘LEARNING CAMPS-TaRL’ TO HAMARA GAON:
Building on the successful experiences with the TaRL Learning Camps, by 2017-18, we took several more steps. These steps were based on questions like:

Once children acquire foundational skills of reading and math, how can we help them sustain these gains, grow and learn further?
Typically, the target population for Learning Camps has been children in Grades 3, 4 and 5 but what about children in other age groups in the village who also need help in catching up?
Most importantly, how to prevent children from falling behind?

The overarching challenge was how to durably change the learning situation in a village or urban community such that at least basic skills or foundational literacy and numeracy was taken care of. In 2018, we decided that we should work for three to five years in the communities where we worked “directly”. (Direct interventions are those in which full-time Pratham team members work directly with schools and communities, children and teachers.) We felt it was possible to work towards the goal of all children reading and doing basic arithmetic. Not only could we support children to learn and thrive but also with the help of local people, create engaging learning environments in the community.
To continue to innovate and evolve, we started the multi-year “Hamara Gaon” (Our Village/Our Community) intervention.
The three-year goals included ensuring that:

Young children develop strong foundational skills, become “ready for school” and progress in a way that will not need catch up efforts in future. (Wherever possible, Hamara Gaon programs bring in a layer of Early Childhood Education working in partnership with the local Anganwadi (Early Childhood Care and Development Centres run by the government).
Children in Grade 3 and above learn to read fluently and with understanding, gain knowledge of numbers and become confident with basic arithmetic operations and calculations.
Children learn how to work in groups with other children to do projects and other activities together.
Local people (families, mothers, youth) engage with children to support their learning.

The overall objective of Hamara Gaon was to understand how in a period of three to five years a village could be enabled in terms of ensuring basic foundations of learning for every child at least for the elementary school age group. We also envisaged Hamara Gaon to be the active laboratory where methods of teaching-learning and materials could be developed, as well as become the locations where impacts on learning could be measured and effectiveness of the approach could be shared more widely with other partners and governments.
HAMARA GAON PROGRAM IN POST-COVID WORLD
The disruptions and discontinuities due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to many changes in the way that we interacted and engaged with the Hamara Gaon communities. Here are some key elements of our renewed efforts:
Youth Volunteers
A stronger push for “catch up” is needed to help children recover from the learning losses of the last two years. During the pandemic, we were able to successfully mobilize community volunteers who ran promising TaRL “catch up” learning camps in communities. Thus, along with work with teachers and schools, youth volunteers will continue to play an ongoing role in supporting children’s learning.
Mothers’ Groups
During the lockdown, we engaged directly with families of young children (pre-school age and those who were of Grade 1 and 2 age). We sent them activities to do with their children via phone messages (SMS and WhatsApp). We also connected regularly with families via phone calls for follow up and feedback. We saw mothers participating actively with their children. Young mothers were encouraged to form their own mothers' groups in the neighbourhood and get together regularly to do activities with their children. In the current version of Hamara Gaon, mothers and mother’s groups have emerged as a vital part of young children’s learning journeys.
In July 2020, the Government of India launched its New Education Policy (NEP 2020).  The document strongly recommends that acquisition of foundational literacy and numeracy in primary grades should have the highest national priority. For us, too, in the next two-three years, it is very important to demonstrate that these national goals are achievable in our local Hamara Gaon communities.
Hamara Gaon today 
The Hamara Gaon program is usually implemented in a cluster of 25 communities (either villages or urban communities. A team of 5-6 Pratham team members are responsible for transforming this community. In 2022-23, the program was operational in 5192 communities and reached ~3,86,000 children.

Early Childhood Education

INTRODUCTION
The focus of Pratham’s Early Childhood Education program is holistic development of children and their readiness for school in the age group of 3-8 years.  This is done with the support of  mothers, school teachers and volunteers in the community.
Holistic development and school readiness include four large developmental domains:
Physical Development
Develop fine and gross motor skills, along with pre-writing abilities and ensure appropriate growth and health
Socio-Emotional Development
Learn to adapt to new settings & people, work in groups, individual, interaction & interpersonal skills
Cognitive Development
Develop basic problem-solving abilities, along with knowledge of colours, shape, symbols etc that are essential for pre-math
Language Development
Develop basic vocabulary and improve the ability to express ideas confidently, both individually and in groups


Context
Early Childhood is a period where brain development is at its peak. Fostering appropriate developmental abilities of children at this crucial stage has been closely associated with improved outcomes, such as better preparedness for school, enhanced retention and all round development of the child.
There is clearly a need to look at the 3 to 8 year old age group in India very closely.The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER 2018) on ‘Young Children’ shows that across India, 28.8% of children at age 3 do not attend any government or private preschool. This report also shows a wide variation in enrollment patterns across states. While the National Education Policy 2020 has laid out that the appropriate age for a child to enter grade 1 is 6 years of age, a significant number of children in government schools are age 5 or below. The data also indicated that children who enter school before the appropriate age of 6 do comparatively worse than their older counterparts in the same grade.

Key Elements
Some distinguishing elements of Pratham’s approach towards Early Childhood Education are:
Local Resources
Contextual content & low-cost material
Regular Assessment
Mother Engagement
This instructor or teacher is a local community member, who has a strong understanding of the local context, which helps her effectively interact with children and engage with parents.
The content is based on the child’s immediate surroundings. Activities are conducted with children in varying setups – big groups, small groups and individually – and are supported with contextualized print and play material such as flash cards, story books, story cards, picture cards, beads, clay and locally available objects of daily use.
Children are regularly assessed by instructors through simple activities and observations. Indicators for assessment are such that they are easy to observe, measure and communicate. The findings of these periodic assessments help instructors track children’s progress and are regularly communicated to parents as an engagement tool.
Mothers are also engaged through periodic meetings, creation of mothers’ groups in the community and individual home visits. Mother engagement includes discussions, games and material creation and distribution.

Delivery Models
Pratham’s work in Early Childhood Education began over 25 years ago with community-based preschool centres in Mumbai, which were run by local young women. Over the years, the program has evolved to include multiple delivery models to suit the dynamic contexts and needs of different geographies across India. Today, Pratham’s ECE program is implemented in the following ways:
DIRECT APPROACH:
Anganwadi Support: This involves mobilization of community volunteers to provide daily instructional activities to children in anganwadis, form and work with mothers’ groups and conduct community events. Pratham provides training and on-site monitoring support to volunteers. Pratham’s anganwadi support model follows a ‘teaching in, reaching out’ approach where efforts are made to engage children both within the institution (i.e. anganwadis) as well as outside it – at home and in the community.
Pratham partners with ICDS and provides support to anganwadi workers across the block. Pratham provides content, material, and demonstrates appropriate teaching practices and supports anganwadi workers in carrying out learning activities with children.
Outside the anganwadi, Pratham engages mothers in the community and encourages them to participate in their child’s learning process. This is done by forming mothers’ groups in every community and facilitating regular meetings where Pratham staff and community volunteers demonstrate learning activities for them to conduct with their children at home and discuss any issues related to their children’s education.
Pratham also conducts school readiness melas in every community before the start of each school year for children about to enter grade 1. This mela encourages a mother and child to come together to participate in the learning focused activities.
See school readiness melas in action in Rajasthan and Assam.
GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIP APPROACH:
In formal government partnerships, Pratham partners with the state/district-level government to strengthen existing government infrastructure and resources for the quality provision of Early Childhood Education, either in Anganwadi centres or in pre-primary classes and early grades within government schools. Pratham and the government jointly work towards the development of the program, including designing curriculum and material, training government personnel and supporting other key elements such as on-site monitoring and mentoring, measurement and assessment and periodic reviews. Pratham views these government partnerships as a key pathway to achieving systemic change.

Measurement
Pratham has an observation- and activity-based approach to measuring children’s progress under the Early Childhood Education program. Assessment under the program is done in two ways:
Teacher-Led Assessment
Sample Based Assessment
Periodic observation-based assessments by the Anganwadi worker/Pratham instructor/school teacher to help understand how each child is doing and track progress over the course of the year.
This information is communicated to parents via a Child Report Card with easy-to-understand grading indicators. Pratham uses this as an effective engagement tool for parents.
Baseline and endline assessments of randomly sampled children from intervention and control units conducted by external Pratham observers. Oral, written and observed data is collected on a variety of activities conducted individually and in small and large groups.
Used to understand the impact of Pratham interventions on preschool children enrolled in Balwadis/Anganwadis as compared to children in the same areas who are not part of Pratham interventions.
Data is collected and can be used for analysis to understand overall status of learning gains through Pratham programs.
This instructor or teacher is a local community member, who has a strong understanding of the local context, which helps her effectively interact with children and engage with parents.
The content is based on the child’s immediate surroundings. Activities are conducted with children in varying setups – big groups, small groups and individually – and are supported with contextualized print and play material such as flash cards, story books, story cards, picture cards, beads, clay and locally available objects of daily use.
Children are regularly assessed by instructors through simple activities and observations. Indicators for assessment are such that they are easy to observe, measure and communicate. The findings of these periodic assessments help instructors track children’s progress and are regularly communicated to parents as an engagement tool.
Mothers are also engaged through periodic meetings, creation of mothers’ groups in the community and individual home visits. Mother engagement includes discussions, games and material creation and distribution.

Reach and Scale
Pratham reaches about 492,000 children through its various ECE programs (around 92,000 through direct programs and an estimated 400,000 through government partnerships). Pratham also facilitated the creation of about 37,000 mothers’ groups.
Pratham’s ECE program is currently active, through either the demonstrations or anganwadi support, in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Delhi, Gujarat, Bihar and Odisha.
Pratham is in state government partnerships for Early Childhood Education in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Haryana.

Elementary

More than 95% of 6-14 year-old children in India are enrolled in schools. However, ASER and other surveys show that a significant proportion of these children complete primary schooling without acquiring foundational reading and arithmetic skills, and therefore, are unable to cope with subsequent curricular expectations. One of Pratham’s key goals is to enable such children acquire basic reading and arithmetic skills, quickly and sustainably, so that they can meaningfully benefit from further education opportunities.


METHODOLOGY

Pratham has developed the CAMaL pedagogy, which stands for Combined Activities for Maximised Learning, to help children “catch up”. CAMaL is a child-centered pedagogy that builds on the Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) approach, pioneered by Pratham, that uses instructions and activities tailored and aligned to the learning level of the child.
At Pratham, we believe that a combination of activities helps children engage and learn. For example, reading aloud, participating in discussions on what they have read or heard, activities with phonetic charts, playing a variety of word games, expressing their own views orally and on paper – are all part of the process of learning to read. We do activities with children in large groups, small groups and individually.

IMPLEMENTATION

Pratham’s foundational learning programs for 6-14 years-olds are primarily implemented in two modes:

Government partnership programs are implemented in partnerships with relevant state or district governments.
Direct programs are implemented by Pratham teams, in collaboration with communities, volunteers and local schools.

Key aspects similar across the two modes of implementation:

At the start of a program, clear, achievable learning goals are articulated so that teams, teachers and other stakeholders know what is to be achieved.
Simple assessment is used to group children for instruction. Later in the program, similar assessments are used to track children’s progress and for regrouping as children make progress.
Even though children may be enrolled in Grades 3, 4, or 5, children are grouped by levels rather than by grades. As children make progress, they move into more advanced groups.
Pratham’s method relies on a set of daily activities to maximise learning.
Appropriate but low-cost teaching-learning materials are developed for the programs; each group has materials to support their activities.

Government Partnership Programs:
Model: In our government partnership programs, teachers trained in Pratham’s CAMaL methodology conduct teaching-learning activities in schools. As mentioned above, children are grouped by their learning levels, using the TaRL approach, and targeted reading and arithmetic activities are conducted for 2-3 hours a day.

 
The teachers are trained, mentored and supported by a cadre of Key Resource Persons (KRPs), typically comprising block and cluster level officials as well as Pratham staff. The KRPs, who we consider as “Leaders of Practice”, are a critical pillar of Pratham’s government partnership programs. Pratham staff trains the KRPs and supports them through the practice classes they are required to run before they train teachers. The practice classes, based on the learning by doing philosophy, enable the KRPs to see first-hand the efficacy and simplicity of the CAMaL pedagogy and equip them to subsequently support and guide the teachers. In addition to mentoring and support, periodic data-based reviews are conducted at different levels of the education system to help assess progress and identify improvement strategies.

Second Chance

India has achieved almost universal enrollment at primary schooling, however, the trend does not sustain as children graduate to secondary grades and upwards. Over the last decade or so, girls have dropped out of school disproportionately due to factors like early marriage, chores at home and cost of education [National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21) data].
Pratham’s experience indicates that once a learner has dropped out of school, it is near impossible for them to find their way back. While India has open schooling opportunities, there is lack of awareness, accessibility, adequate motivation and support for a student to use open schooling as a way to continue their education.
Fewer people progressing for higher studies, low quality secondary education, an ever-increasing demand of a skilled labour force reinforces the need for an effective intervention in the secondary education space. A secondary school certificate is a prerequisite for entry into higher education, skill apprenticeship and for promotion in jobs. Pratham believes that by making education accessible and closer to home, it is possible to overcome logistical and social challenges and begin to bridge the gender gap in learning and education.
Understanding the importance of secondary education, especially Grade 10, Pratham has deployed a focused intervention, the Second Chance program, to enable young girls and women to complete their secondary schooling and forge strong pathways for the future.

Approach

Pratham's Second Chance program focuses on providing school dropouts, especially young girls and women, another chance at education. Second Chance aims to support those who could not complete their secondary education. The program focuses on completion of Grade 10. The academic certificate that they receive opens the door for further opportunities for lifelong learning and growth. The Second Chance program uses innovative teaching methods, to provide accessible learning opportunities very close to where the students live.

REACH & SCALE

Over the years, Pratham has reached more than 40,000 learners through the Second Chance program.

Currently, the Second Chance program is operational in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

DELIVERY MODELS

The Second Chance program prepares and supports students to take the Grade 10 – Secondary Board/Open School examinations. The program runs in two phases. The first phase is called the Foundation Course (FC) which lasts for 3-4 months and focuses on basic foundational concepts of subjects like English, Mathematics, Language (state-specific), Science and Home Science. Assessment in the form of a pre-test at the onset of FC and post-test at the end of FC are conducted to track the learning levels of students and their growth during the course. During this phase, life skills-focused activities are also conducted with the learners, concentrating on enhancement of communication, decision-making and critical thinking skills.
After the Foundation Course, students move to the Main Course which focuses on helping learners prepare for the Board-mandated curriculum. The progress during the Main Course is tracked through internal assessments. Interactive methods such as activity-based learning, group work and an emphasis on self-learning are the highlights of the course. The Main Course formally ends with the students appearing for the Board Examination.
Additionally, the program delivers non-academic modules focused on providing learners exposure to available opportunities after Grade 10.

Digital Initiatives

INTRODUCTION
The Hybrid learning program involves getting children in the age group 10-14 in a village to form their own groups of 5-6 each, thus enabling them to co-create a learning space within their community. Digital devices and content placed directly in the hands of children providing them with opportunities and choices to learn on their own. Community based children’s groups engage in choice-based learning and are guided by the coaches and youth members in the communities. The communities are organized to facilitate and support the learning activities and assessments.
The program aims to create an open learning mechanism enabling children and youth to prepare for school, work, and life. The program has been designed on the premise that children can be motivated to learn on their own. Children learn on tablets and do projects or conduct activities (e.g. role plays, playing games) and then present what they have learned either in front of a live audience of parents or on a video.
Our internal assessments (an RCT conducted in Dausa, Rajasthan) indicate that children in treatment groups perform about 12 percentage points better than the control groups in school curricular subjects, although they are not taught and there is no age-grade curriculum mapped to textbooks created. There are three factors that likely affect the outcome:
Group Learning
Simplified and Interactive Content
A general increase in motivation to learn which counters the negative response to the boredom of the classroom. (over the last two years the average monthly use of tablets by groups is 13 days/month for about an hour every day although there is no “class” held and no one tells them to sit and study.)


PraDigi – ‘Pratham Digital’
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BQegwLRvls&t=4s


Approach
Pratham believes that it takes a village and technology to educate a child. Therefore, Pratham has identified three pillars for the implementation of the H Learning program – Social Structure, Digital Infrastructure and Teaching Learning Methodology.
social structure
Pratham works with the village/urban community to create an environment of learning for children. This is done by interacting with different stakeholders of the community, raising awareness on the education scenario in their community and creating ownership amongst them for the learning interventions.
Digital Infrastructure
The technology aspect of the project involves providing the community access to different digital devices to enhance creation of open learning spaces. This is implemented to motivate the volunteers to facilitate the children’s groups while ensuring the continuation of their own education and learning.
Learning Content
Pratham strives to make content engaging and interesting for learners. It works across three domains of learning – preparation for school, work and life. With the focus on creating contextualized content, the program curatesvideos and games into interesting packages – “courses”. Making learning a choice- driven process. Task based games are being introduced to enable computational thinking among learners.
Building on the know-how, success and reach of our education programs, the digital content endeavours to be an additional input in the overall development of children. Additionally, Pratham collaborates with numerous NGO Partners and platforms, to curate, develop and co-create learning resources for the non-traditional curriculum.


Context
Pratham started its digital intervention with the Hybrid learning program in the year 2015. Today, the H-learning program is a community driven, digitally aided intervention running in approximately 1000 communities of Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh reaching out to over 60,000 students with 6,000 tablets. In 2019, the program has been initiated in urban communities of Pune, Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai.
Subsequently, the digital resources and tablets were made available in Pratham’s foundational programs, Vocational Programs and in the Early Childhood Education programs on an experimental basis. Today, digital hardware and software is available across 21 states reaching 300,000 learners through 18,000 tablets across India. These resources created for different age groups are available on the Pratham Open School YouTube Channel and as learning applications on the Google Playstore.The support of donors and partners has not only led to the expansion of Pratham’s digital programs but also enabled the formation of core content groups within Pratham, producing over 2500 videos and 300 learning games across 11 regional languages.
The 1000 communities of the Hybrid Learning Program continue to be ‘demonstration sites’ where new ideas are implemented, and new resources are experimented with. The program has evolved to enable the learner to make choices from an array of ‘courses’ available across domains and areas of interests. It has also empowered the community by engaging stakeholders and creating a cadre of village level facilitators or ‘coaches’ to support the learning ecosystem in the community.


Measurement
Pratham in its digital intervention measures the involvement and motivation of students through their interaction with the device and their engagement with the content resources. This helps us understand students’ choice, viewing behaviour and interests.

Vocational Training

Pratham launched its Vocational Skilling program in 2005. The objective was to train youth (18‐25 years) from economically disadvantaged backgrounds and provide them with employable skills, coupled with access to employment and entrepreneurship opportunities. Today, Pratham’s Skilling programs are spread across the country to enable youth to access entry-level jobs in 10 major vocations. Pratham’s affiliations include the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and multiple Sector Skill Councils.
In 2020, Pratham re-designed its training models to incorporate digital resources and launched the Hybrid Skilling program, with the primary focus of helping youth find employment in the post-pandemic world.

CONTEXT

India has one of the youngest and largest workforce in the world, with 250 million youth expected to enter the working population over the next 10 years. However, less than 5% of India’s workforce is formally skilled and over 80% of the labour force is engaged in the informal economy. There is a significant gap between the aspirations and abilities of youth. Training youth in vocational courses and entrepreneurship which are aligned with industry demands will help to ensure that the enormous gap between youth aspirations and abilities begins to close.

REACH & SCALE

Pratham runs more than 140 centres across 18 states and 1 Union Territory in India with a placement rate of over 85 percent.
Over the past 10 years, Pratham’s Vocational Training programs have helped more than 200,000 youth across the country access industry-specific training and placement opportunities, through a network of over 2,000 employers. In 2022-23, more than 30,000 youth were trained.

APPROACH

Pratham’s training model is based on strong industry linkages, counselling and hands-on skills training as illustrated below:

LEVEL 1
Self-learning awareness courses which will give youth exposure to a trade, nature of job opportunities and stories of alumni.
Duration of 7-10 days.
LEVEL 2
Virtual training, which covers all the essential theory for the trade. Includes daily instructor-led training sessions.
Duration of 15-20 days.
LEVEL 3
Practical skills training to be completed either at a Pratham training centre, industry partner, or a community-based centre.
Duration of 30-45 days.

In addition to industry-specific skills, students are also offered basic English, computer literacy and life skills. Pratham currently offers certifications related to the following domains:

Care Economy: Beauty, Apparel, Hospitality and Healthcare
STEM Aligned: Electrical, Automotive, Welding and Construction
Green Skills: Solar Panel Repair, Plumbing, Drywall and False Ceiling Repair
IT Enabled Services (ITeS): Multi-functional Office Assistant, Graphic Design, Automotive Showroom Host

Apart from youth, Pratham also trains informal economy workers through two pathways:

For those who are already running micro-enterprises, Pratham provides mentoring and training in the fields of beauty, tailoring, automotive, food production and construction.
For uncertified workers, Pratham provides upskilling and certification in the fields of construction, domestic work, gig work and more.

A unique aspect of Pratham’s vocational training model is the focus on post-placement tracking and support. Youth are tracked and mentored for one year after graduation to encourage them to sustain in the workforce.

Pratham Council For Vulnerable Children

The Pratham Council for Vulnerable Children (PCVC) is the child protection vertical of Pratham with the vision of ‘Every Child's Rights Protected, Every Child in School and Learning Well.’
Started in 2001, PCVC’s focus has evolved from rescue and rehabilitation of child labourers and children in difficult situations to adopting a rights-based approach towards protection and safeguarding the rights of children.


CONTEXT

PCVC started as an outreach program with extensive intervention work in the urban communities of Mumbai consisting of poor migrant families.
We identified thousands of working children between 6 and 18 years of age, engaged in industries like bag-making, shoe-making, cap-making, zari, gold polishing etc. Most of these children were migrants primarily belonging to Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.
The outreach’s major intervention was to rescue children in coordination with the police and the Labour Department and persuading employers not to employ children for work.
Extensive work was then carried out in both source states and destination states of child labourers to mitigate child labour and help repatriated children receive available compensation and rehabilitation facilities.

Over the years, PCVC strengthened its interventions, reaching not only to child labourers but also children on move (unsafe migration of children, runaway children, street children), children with disability, children affected by natural or man-made calamities, children in institutions, children suffering from substance abuse, children in conflict with law, child survivors of sexual abuse and children belonging to the mostmarginalised communities.
Through its work, PCVC strives to reduce the vulnerabilities so as to create a safety net for children by strengthening the child protection mechanisms through partnerships with government and non-government organisations.

REACH & SCALE

PCVC's activities extend to seven states in the country – Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.

In 2022-23, PCVC covered 54 blocks, 18 districts (rural areas) and 730 communities in 9 cities (urban areas). Overall, PCVC reaches around 300,000 children annually through its direct and indirect interventions.

APPROACH

PCVC strategy includes direct work with children and families in vulnerable communities. Indirect work as a resource organisation involves training of different stakeholders working in the field of child protection and partnership with necessary government departments to address these concerns.
PCVC addresses the issues of child rights through multipronged interventions. PCVC’s overall focus is on prevention, remediation, rehabilitation, policy advocacy and documentation for evidence-based practice.
One of the key programs of PCVC is to rescue child labourers from exploitative situations. The aim is to repatriate these children back to their homes and seek rehabilitative measures to sustain them in their local and home settings. To facilitate this, PCVC has established various inter-state connections with the respective government departments, at both source and receiving ends. PCVC also works at important source and receiving points at railway stations in order to mitigate unsafe migration and trafficking of children as a major prevention operation.
On the rehabilitation front, PCVC provides educational sponsorship for the rescued child labourers. This is for the children who attend school on a regular basis (up to 70% attendance) and their progress is monitored by PCVC staff in consultation with the schools. Another rehabilitation initiative is the Family Assistance Project which provides livelihood to the families of these vulnerable children to ensure the sustenance of children in education net and protects them from getting into any harmful practices like child labour. In the past, PCVC has run residential shelters for rescued child labourers in their home state as a demonstration of best practices for the state.

 

 
A crucial prevention program is the Child Rights Help Desk which is set up at various locations to address the concerns of child rights and for local community members to seek redressal for the same. Child rights sessions are also conducted in schools as well as in the community to spread awareness on the child protection concerns.
PCVC also engages in national advocacy-level interventions. These interventions range from establishing inter-state coordination between various state governments and pushing the issue of child rights and protection to a higher priority on their agenda and working towards influencing significantpolicy decisions.

Annual Status of Education Report

ASER Centre is Pratham’s autonomous research and assessment unit. The centre promotes a culture of evidence-based decision making and seeks to develop and use simple yet rigorous methods to generate evidence on scale on the outcomes of social sector programs, especially education. It also aims to strengthen the link between evidence and action by building the capacity of individuals and institutions to design, conduct, understand and communicate the results of assessments that focus on key outcome indicators.

CONTEXT


The word “aser” (pronounced uh-sir) means “impact” in Hindi and in many Indian languages. If development programs are to lead to desired outcomes, their impact on the ground should be regularly assessed. Large sums of public money are channelled into social sector programs. Information on how these investments translate into outcomes on the ground is a major indicator to evaluate their effectiveness.
Currently, independent, timely data on outcomes are not available, especially at the district level. In addition, outside of urban India, there is an enormous shortage of people able to design, implement, and understand the nuts and bolts of assessment. ASER Centre was established to fill these critical gaps.

APPROACH

ASER Centre’s flagship activity is the Annual Status of Education Report (commonly known as the ASER report), a household-based survey that collects information on children’s schooling status and basic learning outcomes in almost every rural district in the country.

The basic nationwide ASER survey is an enormous participatory exercise that has involved about 500 organisations and upwards of 25,000 volunteers every year since 2005. Estimates of children’s schooling and learning status are generated at district, state and national levels. In 2016, ASER switched to an alternate-year model where the ‘basic’ ASER is conducted in all rural districts of the country every other year rather than annually. In the gap years, a smaller survey (typically 1-2 districts per state) focuses on other age groups and domains.

ASER is an annual source of data on children’s learning outcomes for India, and is often credited with changing the focus of discussions on education from inputs to outcomes. The ASER model has been adapted for use by organisations in 14 other countries across three continents. These organisations came together organically to form the People’s Action for Learning (PAL) Network, with a secretariat housed in Nairobi.
In addition, ASER Centre implements large- and small-scale research studies addressing a variety of domains. Conducted in collaboration with institutions such as UNICEF, the World Bank, the MacArthur Foundation, the University of Cambridge, Ambedkar University Delhi, and others, these studies seek to generate evidence that is actionable by both policy makers and practitioners.

 

ASER Centre also conducts a range of capacity building workshops on topics related to collecting and using evidence for action, both within the Pratham network as well as for partner organizations. Key features of all capacity-building modules include the integration of classroom and field activities; the constant movement between theory (or policy) and practice (or ground reality); and the use of a variety of classroom techniques (individual, small group and large group activities).

REACH & SCALE


The basic ASER survey reaches almost every rural district in the country and covers more than 15,000 villages and 650,000 children (the sample size is more than twice that of the survey rounds conducted by the government’s National Sample Survey Organization). Other research, assessment and capacity-building projects vary in reach and scale.

In the intervening years, ASER focuses on different aspects of children’s education and learning. For instance, in 2017 and 2023, the survey focused on the enrollment patterns, learning levels, awareness and aspirations of rural youth aged 14-18 years. In 2019 and 2022, it focused on enrollment and school readiness of young children aged 4-8 years.

CAMaL Ka Camp

What is CAMaL Ka Camp?
A Summer Catch-Up Camp for Children
Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2022 data shows that only 42.8% of Grade V children can read text at Grade II level. This figure was 50.4% in 2018.

School enrollment of children in the 6-14 age group has progressively increased over the years. It reached 96% in 2010 and remained that way till the pandemic. While the problem of “every child in school” has been largely solved, the goal of “every child learning well” is still far from being achieved.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, ASER data showed that children's ability to read or do basic arithmetic needed substantial strengthening in India. Moreover, the pandemic exacerbated this issue, as prolonged school closures and economic disruptions in families led to major learning gaps among children (ASER 2022 data).
The summer of 2023 presented an invaluable opportunity to address the issue of learning gaps and help children before the next school year began. CAMaL ka Camp 2023 (CAMaL: Combined Activities for Maximized Learning) focussed on students in Grade V transitioning to Grade VI in the academic year 2023-24, as well as students in Grades IV and VI.

During the six-week camp, children were engaged in various learning activities to enable them to participate and communicate effectively.

What did we do?
In the summer of 2023 (May-June), Pratham facilitated catch-up camps for children transitioning from primary to the middle school through youth volunteers and government support. The goal was that all children who participated in the six-week camp would be able to read fluently with understanding and that they should be able to express their thoughts orally and in writing by the end of the camp.
Implemented across the states of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, the summer camps witnessed overwhelming response, thanks to the concerted efforts of over 300,000 dedicated volunteers, predominantly youth aged 16 to 20, studying in Grade XI-XII.
Learning was made engaging through various activities. A warm-up involved simple learning games. Storytelling and discussions followed, leading to writing activities. Focus later shifted to letters and words with games like Bara-khadi. Each child created a comprehensive dictionary with words, meanings, sentences, and pictures. Math word problems concluded the class.

Highlights of 2023 Summer Camp

Government Collaboration
The formal support from the Education Departments of the Governments of Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, as well as the continuous support received at the district and sub-district levels in Uttar Pradesh, played a pivotal role in ensuring the smooth execution of the summer camps.
Training and Technology
Every volunteer underwent short yet comprehensive training, equipped with a detailed manual outlining all the activities to be conducted, including resources such as para and story cards and QR codes to access short activity videos. Additionally, they were provided with Hindi language tools and data collection formats. To streamline the process, we employed a user-friendly weblink for volunteer registration, profile updates, and assessment data submission.
Monitoring and Evaluation
To maintain quality and accountability, our dedicated teams from Pratham and government personnel conducted regular on-site visits and telephonic calls to assess progress and verify assessment data submitted by volunteers. This meticulous oversight ensured the credibility and reliability of our outcomes.

Outcomes and Impact

The results have been nothing short of extraordinary. Each of the three states witnessed at least a 24-percentage point improvement in children's ability to read a Grade II level text after only four weeks of instructional activities. The impact has been far-reaching, sparking the need to build from here and ensure a brighter future for these young children.
